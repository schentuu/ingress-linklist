ingress-linklist
================

web based database of portals and suggestions for links

The problem:

A lot (mostly new) ingress players have problems with linking (without blocking).
The maxLinks plugin for IITC is a great idea, but not so usefull on mobile devices.


The idea:

creating a database with a verry simple (and bandwith friendly) web frontend

Step 1:
The database should contain links, that were suggestes by the maxLinks plugin for IITC
Enter the Name of a Portal into a searchfield and get a list of suggested links (if avalible)
In this early state of the project, data has to be inserted by admins

Step 2:
Make the web frontend more usefull.

Step 3:
Parse information from the intel-map or iitc-maxLinks to fill tha database automatically.
